By default this script will skip media tweets (anything with video, images, but not links/cards). Set the `DELETE_MEDIA_TWEETS` constant to `true` if you'd rather nuke old media posts as well. Given that these tend to be more useful as part of a tweet archive (less contemporaneously relevant), you may find they're worth keeping.
